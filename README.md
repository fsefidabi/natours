# Natours  [2021]

This project is a landing page for tours booking website. It was developed in 2021 as part of my early learning phase in front-end development.
At the time of developing this project, I was just beginning to learn HTML and CSS and wasn't familiar with version control systems like Git.
I've decided to add this project to GitHub in 2024 for archival purposes, to showcase my learning journey. The code remains unchanged from its original creation.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS

### Lessons Learned: 
- CSS animations
- pure CSS modals
- media queries and responsiveness
